1) Absolute and relative positioning are two different CSS positioning properties used to control the placement of elements within a web page. They work differently and have distinct purposes:

Ans: Relative Positioning:

When you apply relative positioning to an element, it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. In other words, it respects the space reserved for it in the document layout, and it can still affect the layout of surrounding elements.
Elements with relative positioning can be moved using properties like top, right, bottom, and left, but they are moved relative to their original position.
Useful for making small adjustments or creating layouts where elements need to maintain their position in the document flow but may need slight displacement.
Sibling and parent elements can interact with relatively positioned elements, which means they can influence their position.

Absolute Positioning:

When you apply absolute positioning to an element, it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no ancestor is positioned, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the viewport.
Absolute-positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow, so they do not affect the layout of other elements. This makes them useful for creating elements like pop-up menus, tooltips, and overlay content.
Elements with absolute positioning can be moved using properties like top, right, bottom, and left. These values are calculated based on the nearest positioned ancestor.
Absolute positioning allows for precise control over element placement, but it may require specifying exact pixel values for positioning.

2) Explain the z-index, with a code example.

Ans: The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements, primarily those with a
position value of absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky. It determines the order in which elements are stacked on top
of each other along the z-axis, creating a 3D-like effect even though web pages are inherently 2D.
